  - Iâ€™m currently looking for a **predoctoral research position** in Economics.
  - Also, working on independent research ventures involving **sentiment analysis and LLMs**.
  - The languages I use most often are **R, STATA, and Python**.
  - **Skills:** Data Manipulation/Visualization, Regression Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Forecasting, Web Scraping.
  - **Hobbies:** Music, playing various instruments, going out into nature, drumming, rock-climbing, and cooking.
  - **Fun Fact:** my profile picture is really me!
